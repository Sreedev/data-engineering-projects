## Problem
The objective of this project is to analyze the sales data of a company for the year 2015. As the data is available in raw format, 
we have to clean the data, insert it in a DB, and load it to Power BI to create a pipeline for the data.

## Data
This data is in four tables, and the raw data is in CSV format.

1. pizzas â€” Number of pizzas sold
2. pizza_types â€” Types of pizzas sold by the company
3. orders_details â€” Details of the orders of the company receive
4. order â€” Order details of the company.

## Tools and Format
**Pandas** â€” For reading data, cleaning, connecting to DB, and inserting it into DB.  
**Postgres SQL(PG ADMIN)**â€” For creating DB and hosting the DB.  
**PowerBI** â€” For connecting to Postgres and analyzing the dataset for insights.  
**Python** â€” No need to mention, all this magic happens with Python.

## Analysis result
